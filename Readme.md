## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about the game you chose to build and why.

## Rules
A player ("the Host") thinks of a word or phrase that should be guessed by a second player, ("the Player") letter by letter. To help the Player, a number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word are displayed. 
- If the Player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the Host fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places. 
- If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the Host draws one element of a hangmanâ€™s gallows. As the game progresses, a segment of the gallows and of a victim is added for every suggested letter not in the word. The number of incorrect guesses before the game ends is defined at 10.

## Workflow
**Initialization of the project**
- Creating repository & Readme file on GitHub 
- Look up the rules to understand the mecanisms

**Pre-coding phase**
- Step-by-step approach to discuss the algorithm
- Detailed flowchart to save time for the coding phase

**Development phase**
- First draft of code
- Test & raise issues
- Resolve bugs

**Final presentation**
- Slides
- Pitch
